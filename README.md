# SEP: Computer Vision & Deep Learning Project

## Project Overview
This repository contains our final project for the **Software Engineering Project (SEP) - Computer Vision and Deep Learning** course.

We developed a deep learning solution for **Facial Emotion Recognition Using Deep Learning**.
Our implementation follows the project requirements defined in the course assignment, covering the full pipeline from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## Team Members
* Alen Alija
* Kilian Killer
* Leon Maibauer
* Richard Tscharke

## Repository Structure
Based on our project roadmap, the code is organized as follows:
* `src/`: Source code for the model and training loop.
* `models/`: Model checkpoints and architecture definitions.
* `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

## Getting Started
To run the project locally:

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. **Train the model:**
   ```bash
   python src/train.py
